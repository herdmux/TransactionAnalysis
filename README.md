# TransactionAnalysis
Implementation of crowdsourced reporting on value in a transaction exchange.

It is my beleif, every taxpayer should become an "owner"  in some entitlement or fashion to establish a foundation of positive fiscal mechanics to support generational benefit needs.

As cardholders transact, their mobile device will launch the reporting module. A java swing application to crowdsource input against Bain Research's model of value.  Companies have adopted (to varying degrees) the EOV pyramid in describing the value characteristics associated with provided products and services.  Our app provides balance via a comparative view from customers. 

A goal of Earnlogic's card application and analytic model is to extend demographic perspectives on cardholder financial dispositions.  Important is insight into how well $$ works for a household, not just how much is allocated to budget categories.

On the consumer side, the principal dimensions are gross_earnings, earnings_continuity, earnings_voltility, period_reliable_savings, $-comitted_under_no_choice, $-comitted_under_some_choice, $-uncomitted, $-expected, $-unexpected, $-paid_in_full, $-carried, $-dimension_shifted, $-moved_into_assets_fiduciary, $-moved_into_assets_depreciating.

The above are facets of household financial stability.  Shifts in the above categories are relative-indicative of "wealth building" capability and important to establish visibility into the effectiveness of fiscal health.  

In contrast to the dimensions above, understanding user behavior is critical to targeting benefit systems.  Is cardholder fiscal activity ferral or professional? (idicates a degree of monitary discipline).  Does their behavior shift responsibly when assets limited? Is their spending indicative of responsible or "self-absorbed" use of money?  Are ratios between aspriational-associated spending as apposed to function-associated spending demographically in line?

Crowdsourcing elements of value content from consumers builds a tamperproof system of reporting.  The system is tamperproof because you reporting is associated with spending handled by a bank.  The data feeds into a laddering survey system tracing individual posts and demographically aligned posts.  Also for outlier responses, receipt specifics can/will be analyzed to see if there is evidence of a service discrepency assocaited to the delivery of service or use of a product.  This activity requires interfacing to the users budget history.

The java servlet is designed to be lightweight and fast to conduct.  To support laddering, respondents will be re-approached by email to futher examine their resulting contributions. It was initially intended to process the findings through a stateful stochastic system and report the dispositions for consumption by governing processes. While this is still the plan, the recent introduction to the work of Jacky Mallet has led to the intuition an agent based commercial system may be more descriptively useful as well, efficient.
